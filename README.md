# Hello! I'm Radik
I'm a front-end developer based in Batumi, Georgia with 6+ years of experience in developing websites and web applications. I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript and have professional experience working with React and Vue. I also have experience with the Canvas API and WebGL. I'm interested in game development, art/design, motion design, and music. I lead two music projects: [DTTE](https://open.spotify.com/artist/38MmDiW4NOzG5gvulaQqWQ) and [Bireflector](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0xzoclQiYuYRHA7zTaqPR1).
